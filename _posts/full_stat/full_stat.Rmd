I have been thinking about different data scientists, and I think we need a new term for some: the _full-stat_ data scientist. 

No that is not a typo. Doubtless you have seen much about _full-stack_ data scientists, here we compare and contrast.


## What is a _full-stack_ data scientist?
A full-stack data scientist is one who can code, do stats, define metrics, etc and take an idea from concept through pipeline to database design to building a dashboard. 

They have all of the basic skills of a regular data scientist with the added features of strong data engineering and software engineering skills. 

They are called _full-stack_ because they work with the full stack of data science tools. 

One advantage of full-stack data scientists is that they can own the data science product, from beginning to end. 

They frequently come with computer science degrees, and have taken a few stats courses.

## What is a _full-stat_ data scientist?
A _full-stat_ data scientist is a data scientist who can do much of what a full-stack data scientist can, but is likely less skilled in the data engineering realm. 

They may not have as much experience in building dashboards or pipelines, but they excel in the more quantitative areas. 
They may come with advanced degrees in statistics, probability, and econometrics. 

They model the business situation using whatever techniques are required: analysis, stochastic modeling, simulation, optimization, game theory, etc and determine which statistical techniques are required in order to analyze the data based on the model. 

They can adapt the techniques to the problem when needed, rather than use inappropriate, but standard methodologies, or develop completely novel approaches when needed. 

They are deeply skeptical about data and find anomalies that no-one else does and figures out what to do about them, and they care deeply about uncertainty.
