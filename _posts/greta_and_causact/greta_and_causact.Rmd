The purpose of this project is to illustrate how to use the [causact](https://www.causact.com/) library to build some simple models. Causact allows you to create Bayesian models, and uses the [greta](https://greta-stats.org/index.html) library to do the computations. Well, not really - greta just sets them up, and uses TensorFlow underneath.

The cool thing is with causact you can describe your model as a graph, like this:

and it automatically generates the greta code which you can run to get estimates of everything.
