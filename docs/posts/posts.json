Well, not really - greta just sets them up, and uses\nTensorFlow underneath.\nThe cool thing is with causact you can describe your model as a\ngraph, like this: \nand it automatically generates the greta code which you can run to\nget estimates of everything.\nGet\nstarted!\nMore stuff to come soon about:\n- multilevel models\n- priors\n- posterior predictive distributions.\n\n\n\n",
