Causact allows you to create Bayesian models, and uses the greta library to do the computations. Well, not really - greta just sets them up, and uses TensorFlow underneath.\nThe cool thing is with causact you can describe your model as a graph, like this: \nand it automatically generates the greta code which you can run to get estimates of everything.\nGet started!\nMore stuff to come soon about:\n- multilevel models\n- priors\n- posterior predictive distributions.\n\n\n\n",
