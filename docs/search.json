      "contents": "\nI have applied data science to telecom while at Alcatel (now Nokia), BlackBerry, Akamai; fintech while at Ario/Thinking Capital; and eCommerce while at Shopify.\nI also teach an intro to data science course to MBA students at University of Ottawa.\nI used to co-lead Data for Good in Ottawa: volunteer data scientists trying to make Ottawa better by helping local charities. You can see a bit more about how D4GOttawa used to work, and largely still does, here. It is a great way to improve your data science skills, meet cool people, and help the city.\nYou can find me on LinkedIn and on Twitter\n\n\n\n",
