  I have been doing data science since long before data science was a thing.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```



I have applied data science to telecom (Alcatel, BlackBerry, Akamai), fintech (Ario/ThinkingCapital), and eCommerce (Shopify). 

I also teach an intro to data science course to MBA students at University of Ottawa.  

I used to co-lead Data for Good in Ottawa: volunteer data scientists trying to make Ottawa better by helping local charities.
