  I have been doing data science since long before data science was a thing.

I have applied data science to telecom while at Alcatel (now [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/)), [BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com), [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/); fintech while at  [Ario/Thinking Capital](https://www.thinkingcapital.ca/); and eCommerce while at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/). 

I also teach an intro to data science course to MBA students at [University of Ottawa](https://telfer.uottawa.ca).  

I used to co-lead [Data for Good in Ottawa](https://ottawa.dataforgood.ca/): volunteer data scientists trying to make Ottawa better by helping local charities.
